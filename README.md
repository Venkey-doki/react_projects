# 📘 React Projects Repository

Welcome to the **React Projects Repository**! This is a curated collection of small, focused React applications, each targeting a distinct concept or pattern in React development. Whether you're learning or revising, this repo is structured to help you understand React concepts in isolation and through practice.

## 🎯 Repository Purpose

This repository is designed to serve as a **learning and revision tool**. Each folder represents a mini-project focused on:

- A specific React feature or API (e.g., Hooks, Routing, Context API)
- Integration of third-party libraries (e.g., Material-UI, Axios)
- Design and architectural patterns in React (e.g., component structuring, reusability)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
react_projects/
├── api_calls/             # Projects showcasing REST API integration using fetch & axios
├── component_libraries/   # UI projects using Material-UI, Ant Design, etc.
├── components/            # Reusable and dynamic React components
├── css_pract/             # CSS Modules, Styled-Components, and vanilla CSS usage
├── hooks/                 # Projects utilizing useState, useEffect, useRef, custom hooks
├── rendering/             # Conditional rendering, list rendering, and rendering optimizations
├── router/                # Client-side routing with react-router-dom
├── state_management/      # Context API and Redux based state management demos
```

Each project is self-contained with its own `package.json` and `README` (where applicable).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Venkey-doki/react_projects.git
cd react_projects
cd [project_directory]
npm init
```

> Most projects run at `http://localhost:3000/` by default.
> if your using Vite then they run on `http://localhost:5173/` by default.
